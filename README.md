# Latent-DNFs
Code accompanying the INNF submission "Latent Transformations for Discrete-Data Normalising Flows"

Please stay tuned, we will publish our code in the near future. 

My apologies for the long wait, this should have been uploaded sooner. If anyone's interested in this, know that I still intend to publish the code.
